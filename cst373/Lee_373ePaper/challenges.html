		<p>The damage that Edward Snowden has done will be felt for decades to come. The goal of Edward Snowden are to provide the public with information on these programs so that the public would do something about it. The future will be split between people that agree with him being a whistleblower and some would say he is a traitor. The future of him being of whistleblower seems gloomy. In a comment made by Edward Snowden, “The greatest fear that I have regarding the outcome for America of these disclosures is that nothing will change. People will see in the media all of these disclosures. They'll know the lengths that the government is going to grant themselves powers unilaterally to create greater control over American society and global society. But they won't be willing to take the risks necessary to stand up and fight to change things to force their representatives to actually take a stand in their interests.” This not only affects the public it will affect companies and countries in the way they interact with the US. Big internet companies are affected by what the whistleblower did. Major public figures in other parts of the world would be more cautious about what the NSA can do. Many terrorist groups have changed the way they communicate with each other. </p>
		<p>After such an event happening inside the NSA, there will definitely be a change in future whistleblowers. One of the posts by danah boyd <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2013/07/19/edward-snowden-whistleblower.html">stated</a> that, “Ironically, the government's efforts to deter future whistleblowers by being tough on Snowden is most likely to backfire. This kind of zero-tolerance approach assumes that those who are engaging in whistleblowing are operating under the same logic, priorities, and values as government actors. Sure, plenty of people don't come forward because they're too scared; that's not new. But because of how the government responded to Snowden, those who are willing to take on the big fight now have a model for how to do it, how to iterate based on what they learned watching Snowden. The US government, far from deterring future whistleblowers, has just incentivized a new generation of them by acting like a megalomaniac.” Many people in the future will still consider what Snowden did was a right thing and he did it for the public; however, the US will still treat Snowden unfairly because of what he did to the US. In one of Snowden’s statements he <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/edward-snowden-nsa-guardian-interview-109043.html">said</a> that he is, “much happier in Russia and feels very fortunate to have received asylum, saying he’d be facing an unfair trial in the U.S., he did emphasize his criticisms of Russia’s recent laws on Internet censorship and surveillance.”</p>
		<p>Over time there has been changes in the way people think of the NSA. Most big internet companies find what Edward Snowden did really hurt the companies themselves. The impact of the Snowden leaks could threaten the future architecture of the modern Internet. In recent years, computing power has shifted from individual PCs to cloud computing. According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance it stated that, “The Snowden revelations undermined trust in U.S.-based cloud services by revealing how some of the largest American tech companies using cloud computing -- including Google and Yahoo -- had their data accessed by the NSA. About 10 percent of non-U.S. companies have canceled contracts with American cloud providers since the NSA spying program was disclosed.” U.S. cloud providers could lose as much as $35 billion over the next three years as fears over U.S. government surveillance prompt foreign customers to transfer their data to cloud companies in other countries. These actions that Snowden did have a huge negative impact on a global scale. Being a whistleblower has caused trouble with the NSA in other parts of the world. Many enemies in other parts of the world are being affected by the event. It was stated in an article that, “The biggest concern, NSA officials say, is that foreign individuals or groups targeted for surveillance may now switch to more secure communication methods.” This would definitely cause more concern for the NSA. All the negative events that have happened can have a negative impact on Snowden being a whistleblower for the public.</p>

		<p>I think that the best way to solve the problem is to let the people decide what is right and wrong. It is true that Edward released confidential information, but he did it for a good reason. I think Snowden should not be taking all the blame. The NSA should take responsibility for what they did. The president, senate, and congress should look at the evidence that has been provided and see that the privacy of US citizens are being violated. </p>
