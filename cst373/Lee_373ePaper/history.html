      	<p>About one and a half years ago, the world began to learn that the National Security Agency’s reach into the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the United States and around the globe, as it collects information about their phone calls, their email messages, their friends and contacts, how they spend their days and where they spend their nights. The public learned in great detail how the agency has exceeded its instruction and abused its authority, prompting outrage at Congress, which may finally begin to limit these practices.</p>
      	<p>All of this is entirely because of information provided to journalists by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who stole a collection of highly classified documents after he became disillusioned with the agency’s eagerness for more personal data. Snowden is now living in Russia, on the run from American charges of espionage and theft, and he faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life hiding from the NSA.</p>
      	<p>One of the cultural and technological event that have preceded it is the 9/11 attack. Before the attack happened the NSA has already collected all the information and facts on the people that might be involved. Snowden discussed in the <a href="http://rt.com/usa/162576-nbc-snowden-september-attack/">article</a> that, “We actually had records of the phone calls from the United States and out. The CIA knew who these guys were. The problem was not that we weren’t collecting information, it wasn’t that we didn’t have enough dots, it wasn’t that we didn’t have a haystack, it was that we did not understand the haystack that we have.” Even though they have all that information they dint have the knowledge and understanding to piece the event together. Many should question why bother having all this information and data when the citizens of the US cannot even be protected. </p>
      	<p>Some of the key players are the NSA, Edward Snowden, US citizens, and other countries. The NSA is the main key player. They are involved with handling all the private information and data of citizens, companies, and other countries. Edward Snowden is another key player. He was the person who released secrets about what the NSA did to the journalist. The US citizen is in the middle. They are the very people that the NSA and Edward Snowden is trying to protect in their own way. The other countries that are involved are considered foreign intelligence to each other. If private information about the NSA were to leak out, then the other countries can definitely have an advantage over the other.</p>
      	<p>There have been many attitudes and behavior changes in the past and the present. In the <a href="http://archive.digtriad.com/news/national/article/313390/175/Poll-Most-Americans-Now-Oppose-The-NSA-Program">article</a> it stated that, “In trading off between civil liberty and national security, the American public decisively favors national security when it feels the threat acutely and imminently but tilts in the other direction when the threats seem more remote”. Before whistleblower Edward Snowden came into the picture many Americans favor national security over civil liberty because they felt safe. The citizens weren’t aware of what’s happing behind the NSA’s curtain. In the <a href="http://archive.digtriad.com/news/national/article/313390/175/Poll-Most-Americans-Now-Oppose-The-NSA-Program">article</a> it stated that, “Attitudes toward the surveillance program have turned more negative since last June and July, when the Snowden revelations were new. In polls in June and July 2013, more Americans approved of the program than disapproved. Now, by 53%-40%, a majority disapproves.” From this we can see that after the public have found out what the NSA is doing they have mixed feelings and opinion about their privacy. Before the Snowden event citizens thought that their privacy are protected, but now they have realized that their privacy is not as safe as they have imagined. </p>
      	<p>Privacy is the most important aspect to all human beings. There are laws that are made to uphold those privacy. In the Declaration of Independence it was <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html">stated</a> that, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness”.</p>
      	<p>The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776. Richard Henry Lee brought what came to be called the Lee Resolution before the Continental Congress. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted to declare independence from England. These laws are never challenged because they are considered the philosophical foundation of American freedom.</p>
