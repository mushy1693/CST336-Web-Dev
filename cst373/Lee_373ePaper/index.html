      	<p>My name is Nelson Lee, and I'm currently a senior transfer student at CSUMB, majoring in Computer Science and Information Technology, with a concentration in Software Engineering. This is my ePaper for CST 373, Ethics and Current Issues in Information Technology.</p>
      	<p>I chose this major because I am passionate about working with computers. I love everything about computers, such as how it works and what it can do. My concentration is towards software engineer; however, my interest currently is in web development. So I would consider myself working towards being a software engineer and also a web developer. Besides software, I also like working with hardware too. I love computer repair and maintenance because being able to repair and operate a computer is important in this field.</p>
      	<p>I will explore the ethical issues relating to whether what whistleblower Edward Snowden did can be considered a hero or a traitor. The personal and societal values at stake are the confidentiality and security of our information. I am interested in this topic because of the motivation behind Edward Snowden’s release of information about the NSA is to protect the right to privacy in every American citizen that live in the US. This issue is worth studying because privacy is valued by US citizens; however, the NSA does not respect that privacy. They are crossing the boundary between protecting the US and limiting the amount of privacy that American citizen receive.</p>
      	<p>The reason why this issue is so important is because people’s privacy is slowly being intercepted and analyzed by the NSA. The motto of the NSA is to protect the US from foreign countries. Their job is to analyze and intercept all data that deals with foreign intelligence; however after 9/11, NSA has increased information analysis and interception. They are trying to collect more data from US citizens. </p>
      	<p>Overall, this issue is significant because the citizens are unknowingly giving up their rights to privacy. The citizens aren’t aware of what the NSA is doing or how they are collecting data; however, after the news that were released to the public by Edward Snowden many people are beginning to question whether it is ethical for the NSA to be collecting data about American citizens.</p>
      	<p>In this paper, I will explore the methods of how the NSA is collecting data about American citizens and discuss how these methods are an invasion of privacy. The question is whether it is acceptable for the NSA to collect data about US citizen. Where does NSA draw the line between protecting US citizen and the rights to privacy? Should the public know of the programs that are running inside the NSA? Why did Edward Snowden release information on these programs? Do the citizen have to right to bring down these government programs? All these questions need to be discussed because it affects not only the individual but the entire society.</p>
