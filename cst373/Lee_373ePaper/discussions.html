      	<h1>Information technology Professional</h1>
      	<p>Assume that you are an IT professional in the NSA and your boss tells you to intercept all data that goes between the Russian President and anyone he contacts with. How will you react and respond to this?</p>
		
		<h1>Information technology User</h1>
		<p>Assume that you are a user and the NSA has recently announced to the public that all data that goes through internet companies and phone companies should be required to be collected. How will you react and respond to this?</p>
		
		<h1>Information technology Policy</h1>
		<p>Assume that you are a policy maker and the NSA is giving you policies on different types of programs that involve the interception of American privacy such as email, text and calls. The NSA tells you that these programs are necessary and important to our national security. How will you react and respond to this?</p>
      
      	<h1>Answers</h1>
      	
      	<h3>K.S.</h3>
      	<p>- I would do what my boss asked.  He is intercepting data on a foreign leader and dealing with security. If a citizen here is communicating with the Russian president, they will be monitored also.</p>
      	<p>- I do not think this is right. I would probably first look into trying to protect my data.  Maybe I could find a company that found a way around this. I would also be very careful of what data I gave to the phone and internet companies. I would also protest this action.</p>
      	<p>- The government always says it is important to our national security when they want to gather information and spy.  I don't buy it. I would resist this any way I could.</p>
      	<h3>B.R.</h3>
      	<p>- I would react by asking any relevant questions of why the Russian President needs to be monitored and then I would act accordingly. By accordingly, I mean I would monitor the Russian President because it is my job.</p>
      	<p>- I would ask what the reasoning for the internet/phone companies to be collected upon is. If the reason has to do with national security then I would begin collecting the data.</p>
      	<p>- I would set strict guidelines on what the requirements would be to do this. I would say they need to record and issue warrants to receive the data. I would also say that any imminent threats to people’s lives (death or injury) would allow the NSA to gather data to protect them.</p>
      	<h3>T.L.</h3>
      	<p>- This most likely happens every day between many countries, and if I worked for the NSA I would probably do stuff like this every day anyways. His motive for tasking me with this project is probably to mitigate any national security threat that he got wind of, and I can save millions of lives by hacking the Russian president, then I'm all for it.</p>
      	<p>- This data is already collected by ISPs and phone companies, so this would not be news to me. I don't do anything I shouldn't so I couldn't care or less if somebody was reading my text messages. I don't think this is necessary nor should it be legal, but it does not affect me.</p>
      	<p>- If I was a policy maker I would not allow for the NSA to do this all-encompassing data collection, simply because it's not necessary. People want their privacy, and if terrorists want to communicate privately, they will find the means.</p>
      	<h3>B.C.</h3>
      	<p>-  It being my job I would do as I am told there aren't too many ethical issues the NSA worries too much about.</p>
      	<p>- If it is announced and cannot be avoided I personally would not think too much about it. Either way if they wanted to get ahold of your information they would, and as long as you’re not doing anything stupid you should have nothing to worry about.</p>
      	<p>- Once again this would just mean it is official that the NSA will legally be intercepting your data which would be no different than now, and if you don't you simply won't be able to use the technology.</p>
      	<h3>D.C.</h3>
      	<p>- If it is for my job and it is to protect loved ones and my country I will do the desired task. If there is a possible threat then I find it completely okay. Other than that there should be no reason to intercept the data.</p>
      	<p>- I would probably find a way around this. If there was no way around it I would limit the amount of information that I access through these devices.</p>
      	<p>- I would have to disagree with them that all this information is important and I would try to fight it. I would let them know how I feel on the fact that this is taking all forms of privacy away from the people.</p>
      	<h3>B.G.</h3>
      	<p>-  I will react in a way that I will be asking my boss what the reasoning behind my task and how the results be used. I will in the end do what I’ve been told to do but I will be skeptical about it unless I am informed of why I have been assigned to do that and where the information will go to.</p>
      	<p>-  I will not react in a way where I feel violated but I will know that it is not correct. I do not use the internet in a bad way, but I should still feel as if I have some type of privacy. I will also feel like questioning why this is being done and how the information will be used and why.</p>
      	<p>- I will question the reasoning behind why all of these changes have come up all of a sudden. They might say they are necessary and important but I feel the need to know what is going on before I take any further actions regarding the policies. Privacy is a big issue that continues to be attacked, to a point where it will no longer exist within us.</p>
