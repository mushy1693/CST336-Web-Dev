      	<p>There have been many views on whether Edward Snowden is a hero or a traitor. Of course, nothing is so simple, but Snowden's actions have definitely divided people. According to recent polls, most Americans consider Snowden to be more of a whistle-blower than a traitor. However, the same polls indicate more Americans believe Snowden's actions were mostly bad for the U.S. Overall this issue has resonated with many people, groups, and companies in the world.</p>
      	<p> For many around the world, and a growing number of Americans, Snowden is a hero and the whistleblower who put his own freedom at stake to reveal shocking abuses by the US intelligence agencies. Much of what Snowden has done certainly looks like a whistleblower. First, he does not appear to have sought money for his disclosures. Indeed, he appears to have thought more about what he was taking than where he was taking it. Secondly, and most importantly, is the breathtaking disclosures that he made.</p>
      	<p>What so many people around the world admire about Snowden is precisely what makes him such a hated figure within government. He broke the rules and worse yet, embarrassed some of the most powerful leaders in Washington. He obviously broke the law in removing and disclosing classified information - material potentially harmful to the security of the United States. </p>
      	<p>The debate has raged across time zones: from the US and Latin America to Europe and to Asia. Barack Obama <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/07/obama-putin-talks-canceled-snowden">cancelled a trip</a> to Moscow in protest at Russian president Vladimir Putin's protection of Snowden. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/17/brazil-president-snub-us-nsa">cancelled</a> a state visit to Washington in protest at the US spying on her. Bolivian president Evo Morales's plane was forced down in Vienna amid suspicion that Snowden was being smuggled out of Russia.</p>
      	<p>In Germany, a "livid" Angela Merkel <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/23/merkel-phone-tapped_n_4150812.html">accused</a> the US of spying on her, igniting a furor that has seen the White House concede that new constraints on the NSA's activities may be necessary. Meanwhile, in Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/david-cameron-nsa-threat-newspapers-guardian-snowden">accused the Guardian</a> of damaging national security by publishing the revelations, warning that if it did not "demonstrate some social responsibility it would be very difficult for government to stand back and not to act".</p>
      	<p>US <a href="http://rt.com/usa/microsoft-nsa-snowden-leak-971/">internet companies</a>, their cooperation with the NSA exposed by Snowden's documents, fear a worldwide consumer backlash, and claim that they were forced into cooperation by the law. Now many companies that have been working with the NSA are fearing that the public might start an outburst towards the company’s cooperation. </p>
      	<p>Much of the NSA’s defense is that the public should be unconcerned, basically they are saying: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” But civil liberties groups such as the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/snowden-motivated-what-internet-was-it-was-being-watched-and-how-we-can-get-there">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/message-edward-snowden-one-year-later">American Civil Liberties Union</a> warn that surveillance goes well beyond what Congress intended and what the US constitution allows.</p>
      	<p>Many of these people, groups, and companies are looking into this matter through articles and videos. Many of the programs and spying are represented in these social media. That is why many of the companies are beginning to take action on what happened. Foreign leaders and companies are also taking action on what the articles and videos have released about what the NSA is secretively doing outside the US. </p>
