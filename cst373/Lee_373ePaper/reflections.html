		<p>Overall, my personal opinion is that Edward Snowden is a whistleblower. He is telling the public about what the NSA is doing and how this affects all American privacy. The public has the right to know what these programs are and if the programs are suitable for the public. Edward saw that the NSA is overstepping their line and taking matters and judgment into their own hands. They are determining what can be collected and that is not right.</p>
		<p>The NSA always wants more power to collect more data and protect the citizen; however, the data and information they have collected have never really helped prevent danger to American citizens. They had data and information before 9/11 but couldn’t really do anything with it. The Boston marathon bombing was exactly the same thing. They could have prevented it, but they didn’t. So the overall impression of what the NSA is doing in unnecessary. My attitudes have definitely changed about the NSA and Snowden surrounding the big picture. Snowden has done the public a big service revealing the things that the NSA did that was violating American privacy. </p>
		<p>The way America is treating Snowden is considered wrong. They are depriving him the right to free speech. There should be laws and policy to enforce the way the NSA operates and the way they collect information. Congress should take the documents and the public’s opinion into consideration. The US was formed from the Declaration of Independence and it stated that if the public find a government to be unnecessary, then they can abolish it to create a new government. Clearly there are many citizens who find what the NSA is doing is wrong and unnecessary. So laws and policies should be enacted to protect the general public. </p>
