		<p>There have been many different media views as to whether Edward Snowden is a hero or a traitor. Newspapers, news television, internet articles are providing insights into whether what Snowden did was patriotic. Media such as The Washington Post, Huff Post, and YouTube are grabbing attention on this issue. Edward Snowden has released many articles and did many interviews on the news article. Edward Snowden’s goal is to release the news to the public. When Edward Snowden met journalists in his cramped room at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB4Gn0u4DSE">Hong Kong's Mira hotel</a> in June, his mission was ambitious. Amid the clutter of laundry, meal trays and his four laptops, he wanted to start a debate about mass surveillance. He succeeded beyond anything the journalists or Snowden himself ever imagined. His disclosure about the NSA resonated with Americans from day one. But they also exploded round the world.</p>

        <p>Many of the media that are packaging this story provided details on the pros and cons of what Snowden did. They also included government programs that he has disclosed to the public. These programs are being judged on whether it helped the public or harmed the national security of the US. There have not been much bias in the media. The only bias that is significant is when he gave his first video appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQLy012pNDs">NBC</a>. He discussed on the topic of how the NSA knew what really happened before 9/11; however, they dint do anything about it. NBC tried to block and limit this comment out to the public and hope that the public dint find out. Just because he is considered a fugitive of the US, doesn’t give them the right to deny him the ability to free speech. All citizens have freedom of speech; however, from what has happened we can see the news company is denying Snowden the right to public speech. Most of the media tried their best to portray whether Edward was a hero or a traitor. The provided concrete proof and evidence of what he did and said to the public. Some defended Edward says that he is reminding the public that their liberty should not be so easily given up. There are some argued that what he did was wrong and should be tried for treason.</p>
