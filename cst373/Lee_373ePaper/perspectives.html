      	<h3>Egoism or Self Interest</h3>
		<p>The perspective of egoism definitely applies to Edward Snowden. It is defined that “Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others.” Snowden did not in any way mean to harm or hurt anyone but he did.</p>
		<p>In the eyes of an egoist he displayed self interest in pursuit to release confidential information to the general public. His motives, goals, and intentions were pure; however, his actions have caused nothing but damage to companies, governments, and also many public officials around the world.</p>
		<h3>Social Group Relativism</h3>
		<p>The perspective of social group relativism definitely applies to Edward Snowden. It is defined that “standards of conduct in our personal life and in business are governed by the expectations of others on our behavior.” Snowden is struggling between the organization he works for and his ideology on public’s rights and freedom.</p>
		<p>In the eyes of a person who is raised on the idea of social group relativism, he has displayed a struggle within himself again and again while working for the NSA. He tells his supervisor about the things he saw and how he felt that it was wrong to be spying on people around the world. The supervisor continuously stated that there weren't any problems and the things being done here are for the safety and security of our country; however, deep down he felt that the public should be the ones to decide whether the programs the NSA are using are right for the public. Edward did the right thing by releasing this information to the world. He did the world a big favor by revealing information on programs that the NSA was running in secrecy. The socially relevant referent for action here is the public interest group.</p>
		<h3>Individualism</h3>
		<p>The perspective of individualism definitely applies to Edward Snowden. It is defined that “a social theory favoring freedom of action for individuals over collective or state control.” Snowden had done the public a good service in revealing the confidential information. Now the citizens of the US are more aware of what the NSA is really doing and they are disagreeing with the ways that they are being monitored. </p>
		<p>In the eyes of individualism he has displayed a sense of favoring for freedom for the general public. He risked his life to get the information out so the people of the US can choose whether these programs are really necessary for the protection of every individual in the US.</p>
