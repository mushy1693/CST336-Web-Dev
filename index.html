		  	<p>Hi! I am currently going to school at CSUMB. I am majoring in computer science and information technology. I chose this major because I have a lot of compassion when working with computers. I love everything about computers such as how it works and what it can do. My concentration is towards software engineer. I find that designing and programming software is very unique and fun. It gives me the power to create new technology for the world. </p>
